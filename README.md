# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

In this project I am working with unsupervised learning in order to analyze crypto currency options. I am grouping the available cryptocurrencies into a classification system in order to evaluate them for new investment. I used a clustering algorithm and converted the data into visualizations to provide the uknown outputs that unsupervised learning can process. 

## Results

An elbow curve was created in order to determine the optimal number of clusters. In my model the elbow occurs at 4.

I used plotly.express.scatter_3d to provide a visualization for the 4 clusters.

Finally, I created a 2D scatter plot of TotalCoinSupply and TotalCoinsMined.
